        We are about to start the new year 2021 and the last year has been quite
        different and influenced the way we designed a lot. But let’s not talk
        about the last year but rather focus on the future! I am working as an
        in he human brain is incredible. It has around 100 billion neural
        connections and can process billions of bits of information every
        second. It’s an extraordinary piece of organic technology whose
        abilities can be even more significantly expanded thanks to brain
        interfaces. In the near future, brain interfaces may very well become a
        major input method.

        computer by using their brain activity. Neurons within the brain are
        connected by dendrites and axons.
